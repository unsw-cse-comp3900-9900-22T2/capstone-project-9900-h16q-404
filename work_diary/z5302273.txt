week 1
The first tutorial was not very good since only three students went there. So we found a group of three and sent mails to other students to ask if they want to join us. We had a brief discussion about the choice of our project. Because we did not want to spend much time on some AI based recommendation system we decided to pick project #7 the event management system. I set up the Microsoft Teams channel and invited members.
We started to use Google document to write the materials and ideas about the proposal and project.

week 2
Before the lab I wrote some user stories to the shared Google document as log.
During the tutorial we met each other and dicussed about the project. We made our decisions about the novel features, discussed our strength and weakness and briefly allocated some tasks.
We also discussed about the basic structure of the project. It would be divided into two parts - frontend and backend, and the backend is also made of two parts, functions and database. The frontend would be ReactJS, backend are Flask and sqlite.
The scurm master is given to Ben since he is much experienced in project development.
We decide to take 1 week sprint since most of us is not too busy so that we can change the plan if something goes wrong.
We decided to have another meeting every Sunday morning and my task this week is to choose a design tool and make some prototypes of storyboard so that after the user stories are given we can transform them into storyboards.
I chose draw.io ( a website ) and make several boards before Sunday.

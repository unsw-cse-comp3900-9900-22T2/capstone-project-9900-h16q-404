week 1
The first tutorial was not very good since only three students went there. So we found a group of three and sent mails to other students to ask if they want to join us. We had a brief discussion about the choice of our project. Because we did not want to spend much time on some AI based recommendation system we decided to pick project #7 the event management system. I set up the Microsoft Teams channel and invited members.
We started to use Google document to write the materials and ideas about the proposal and project.

week 2
Before the lab I wrote some user stories to the shared Google document as log.
During the tutorial we met each other and dicussed about the project. We made our decisions about the novel features, discussed our strength and weakness and briefly allocated some tasks.
We also discussed about the basic structure of the project. It would be divided into two parts - frontend and backend, and the backend is also made of two parts, functions and database. The frontend would be ReactJS, backend are Flask and sqlite.
The scurm master is given to Ben since he is much experienced in project development.
We decide to take 1 week sprint since most of us is not too busy so that we can change the plan if something goes wrong.
We decided to have another meeting every Sunday morning and my task this week is to choose a design tool and make some prototypes of storyboard so that after the user stories are given we can transform them into storyboards.
I chose draw.io ( a website ) and make several boards before Sunday.

Meeting on Sunday and my samples are good. We decide to continue the work and My work is to make all storyboards with Eddie.

week 3
First two days I worked on boards and on Wednesday I had a meeting with Eddie and we split the workload and finished them later. On Thursday Morning I wrote the description for my storyboards.
Thursday meeting
I asked Dylan about the details of payment and refund and got the answer that we do not need to involve actual money but just some mock information.
Eddie and I showed the boards and desc to the group and discussed about the design. I found some points were not mentioned in user stories.
I need to finalise the design of the boards and add more text details and descriptions to them.
Friday and Saturday
Write details desc and change some design
Sunday meeting
We review the draft of the proposal.
Go through all the boards and find some minor mistakes to fix.
Unify the different designs between mine and Eddie's.
I need to design the API between frontend and backend based on the upcoming database (relational model design).
Finished the graphs before Sunday and fixed some problem.

week 4
I thought about the API design of the background and had a look at some old projects
But I think I need more infomation on this.
Overall API can be divided into two parts: User related API and event related API. And some content may require a combination of several APIs.
